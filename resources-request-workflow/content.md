![portal](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4024/4705811372_f41a14ca64.jpg)

The goal of this portal is to better connect those in need of learning & leading curriculum with existing resources, opportunity and ideas that will improve overall quality of outcomes through regular iteration on feedback.

## Discovery Process

We have a [growing](http://education.mozilla-community.org/) library of quality, tested [learning and leading](http://emmairwin.github.io/) resources. Our library includes even more content still in draft, or testing phases.

This process seeks to better understand your goals for learning outcomes related to community leadership development and then make recommendations for developing that content. Example scenarios listed below.

**To begin the discovery process please fill out this [simple form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jCy-e9n4qf2BSIs7wWFHcUYigAnJu3JHKA4TbA1OXoI/viewform)**

##### Example Scenarios

* Existing content (like [Design Thinking](http://mozilla.github.io/participation-curriculum/design-thinking/index.html#))
* Fork of existing content for slightly different outcomes (Like [Your First Pull Request](http://emmairwin.github.io/2015-02-26-your-first-pull-reqest/)).
*  'Break Out' content from a bigger course into it's own workshop. (like [secondary research](http://mozilla.github.io/participation-curriculum/interviewing-users-for-mozilla/index.html#1-secondary-research)).
* Build on an existing draft (like [Building Bridges to Mozilla](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1US8gLMoucaRH46pOZIHSHyrAU4v18iU289rOEH_GDr0/edit#slide=id.g10738dd625_0_0)).
* CC licensed OER content suggestions.
* Proposal for new content.

## Contributing Resources

If you are in any stage of development, or testing resources that you think can benefit or compliment existing content. Please [fill out this form](), or submit a [pull request to this list](https://github.com/mozilla/participation-curriculum/blob/master/curriculum-list.md).

NOTE:  Mozilla is working on a database for curriculum , this is temporary way to track.

## Testing Resources

Testing & feedback are core to creating a library of quality resources. All feedback will be considered and implemented in either the original content, or a branched version (as prioritized).
