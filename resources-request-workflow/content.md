![portal](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4024/4705811372_f41a14ca64.jpg)

The goal of this portal is to connect you with clear ways to:

* Request 'learning and leading' resources (new or existing).
* Test and give feedback on existing resources.
* Contribute 'learning and leading' resources.

## Contributing Resources

If you are in any stage of development, or testing resources that you think can benefit or compliment existing content. Please fill out [this form]() to let us know about it.

## Requesting Resources

We have an [ever-increasing](http://education.mozilla-community.org/) library of quality [learning and leading](http://emmairwin.github.io/) resources.

Please fill out this simple form to launch a discovery process that will ask you a few key questions about your learning objectives.  We'll respond quickly with proposals/suggestions  - some examples might be how you might:

* Use existing and tested content (like [Design Thinking](http://mozilla.github.io/participation-curriculum/design-thinking/index.html#))
* Evolve existing content like (Like [Your First Pull Request](http://emmairwin.github.io/2015-02-26-your-first-pull-reqest/)).
* Break out one component of an existing course (like [secondary research](http://mozilla.github.io/participation-curriculum/interviewing-users-for-mozilla/index.html#1-secondary-research)).
* Build on an existing draft (like [Building Bridges to Mozilla](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1US8gLMoucaRH46pOZIHSHyrAU4v18iU289rOEH_GDr0/edit#slide=id.g10738dd625_0_0)).
* Create something new.


## Testing Resources

Testing & feedback are core to creating a library of quality resources.  Please fill out this form to provide feedback on any content you.  All suggestions will be considered and implemented in either the original content, or a branched version.
