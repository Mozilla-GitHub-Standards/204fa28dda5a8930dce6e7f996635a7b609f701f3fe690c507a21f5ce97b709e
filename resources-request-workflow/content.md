![portal](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4024/4705811372_f41a14ca64.jpg)

The goal of this page is to better connect those at Mozilla in need of learning & leading curriculum with the information, resources and support they need to be successful in reaching their goals for community through learning experiences.


* A personalized guide for discovering existing learning & leading resources.
* An opportunity to collaboratively test and improve existing resources in various stages of development.
* Connect your work/resources and ideas with others who might be working on similar learning outcomes.

## Requesting Resources

We have a [growing](http://education.mozilla-community.org/) library of quality, tested [learning and leading](http://emmairwin.github.io/) resources. Our library includes even more content still in draft, or testing phases.  

To begin the discovery process please fill out this [simple form]()

I'll respond with a proposal of content ideas, and suggestions based on the content scenarios listed below.

* And will evolve this based on feedback.

##### Content Scenarios

A proposal will likely contain one or more of the following suggestions for curating learning content.

* Existing content (like [Design Thinking](http://mozilla.github.io/participation-curriculum/design-thinking/index.html#))
* Fork of existing content for slightly different outcomes (Like [Your First Pull Request](http://emmairwin.github.io/2015-02-26-your-first-pull-reqest/)).
*  'Break Out' content from a bigger course into it's own workshop. (like [secondary research](http://mozilla.github.io/participation-curriculum/interviewing-users-for-mozilla/index.html#1-secondary-research)).
* Build on an existing draft (like [Building Bridges to Mozilla](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1US8gLMoucaRH46pOZIHSHyrAU4v18iU289rOEH_GDr0/edit#slide=id.g10738dd625_0_0)).
* CC licensed OER content suggestions.
* Proposal for new content.
