#### Learning Objectives
#### Who can benefit form this workshop

#### Format

The content, and activities in this course were developed for a four-week, online, facilitator-led course and then optimized for self-directed learning.

Each section, represents one week, or between 2-4 hours of learning and activities that help participants learn the basics for success in research through interview.

Each section provides direction & reading with associated activities and self-assessment.

## Materials

## Workshop

## 1. Secondary Research

This week covers secondary research, the first part of any research project! Participants will learn best practices for researching, collecting and documenting existing information on our focus topic: “Connected Devices".

#####To complete this section:

1. Please read through the provided text on Secondary Research.
2. Complete the activity.
3. Select a way to share what you've learned and collected.

#### Introduction

Mozilla is interested in learning as much as possible about how our mission and work can influence the Internet of Things (IoT) in coming years.

#### Secondary Research

> The first part of any research project is secondary research!

**Secondary Research**: involves the summary, collation and/or synthesis of existing research. This means you spend time researching what information and research already exists on our topic. We are focusing only on Secondary Research for this week.

**Primary Research**: is research you generate yourself, sometimes called ‘First Hand’ or ‘Desk’ Research. In weeks 2-4 of this course, we will focus on one primary research method - interviewing.)

> In a market research context, secondary research is taken to include the re-use by a second party of any data collected by a first party or parties.” - Wikipedia

**Examples of Secondary Sources**: documentaries, newspapers, magazines, articles, other research reports, white papers, government statistics, YouTube videos, industry associations, books, store flyers/advertising.

**Some Topics to Consider**: economic and business conditions, industry trends, customer preferences, technological shifts, prices for goods and services, customer demographics and shifts, sales trends.

* If you have access to a local library or university, librarians are amazing resources for conducting secondary research
* When at the library, bookstore or market, look at the titles and products nearby for other ideas and information
* When searching online, use variations in the combinations of words
* In articles, books, and papers, read the footnotes and references at the end for new sources of information and look those up
* Question the source. How recent is it? Does it seem legitimate and credible? Can you find more than one instance of it to confirm? (Anybody can make a website!)
* Don’t take longer than a few minutes for each topic. Go for breadth (you can do depth later).

#### Activity

1. Read [Seven Tips for Lean Market Research](http://www.gv.com/lib/seven-tips-for-lean-market-research)

2. Research! Gather Sources. Search for news articles, online magazines, consumer reports and other resources you can think of to learn as much as you can about ‘Large Screens’. Add your own knowledge, and observations about other people’s setups of “Large Screens” to gather secondary research. *Make sure you keep track of your sources!*

3. Make sense of what you found. Note important quotes, implications or questions you have after reading each source. Organize your findings into subtopics. See if you feel the need for more research on any of the topics. Note areas you find most interesting, or with gaps to help you guide what research questions you will work towards next week.

4. *Share your research!* On this [Discourse thread](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/interviewing-users-for-mozilla-secondary-research/2172), through a blog post or other idea, share your research and your answers to these questions:
  * How did you organize your research?
  * Where did you search? And what techniques did you use ?
  * Do you see any subtopics emerging as a result of your research?
  * What did you learn about how Connected Devices that you didn't know before?
  * What was your overall experience? Was researching fun? Challenging? Frustrating?

## 2. Interview Planning
![fieldnotes](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8806/17743377585_c15e637587.jpg)

Participants will learn to create an interview guide, which includes creating materials and tools needed to facilitate conversations, and review afterwards.

#####To complete this section:

* Embrace How Other People See the World ! Read Chapter 2 & 3 of our book.
* Create Screening List.
* Using a shareable format of your choice, create a field guide for the "IoT and Mozilla". Check Figure 3.5 in your book for an example.
* [Share links to your work]("https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/interviewing-users-for-mozilla-interview-planning/2229) (and anything else you want to share), on Discourse for this weeks topic.

### Self Assessment

* What is the best mindset for interviewing people? What are ways to get into this mindset?
* What are the benefits of interviewing people where they live or work?
* What things should you, as an interviewer do to avoid negatively influence an interview?
* What ways can you think of that help you build a rapport with community members at Mozilla? How do you think those can help you when interviewing people you're interviewing?
* Have you noticed ways body language can impact a conversation, for example a conversation you recently had?
* In what, if any situation is it appropriate and constructive to share your own opinion or experience?
* Thinking about people in your life, what ways do you already use to help put people at ease ? How can you extend those same skills to interviewing?


## 3. Interviewing Techniques

This week we'll learn about and practice our interviewing skills while challenging ourselves to improve on our questions, timing and other aspects of a 'good interviewer'.

> Interviewing involves more than just interviewing! It is absolutely the core of the interaction with your participant, but there are other techniques (or if you prefer, methods; or if you really prefer, methodologies). You should consider the interview itself as a platform and try to organically integrate a larger set of techniques.

#### Activity

In your book:

* Read Chapter 5 “ Key Stages of the Interview ".
* Read Chapter 6 “ How to Ask Questions ”.
* [Watch these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t-_hYjAKww) examples of poorly, and well done interview examples.

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> Although some content in this week's activities covers 'partnering with other for an interview', we won't specifically focus on team interviewing in this course.

#### Bonus Reading

* [Never Ask What They Want - 3 Better Questions to Ask in User Interviews](https://medium.com/user-research/never-ask-what-they-want-3-better-questions-to-ask-in-user-interviews-aeddd2a2101e#.6gp9d4wx2)

## 4. First Interview!

This week will will provide participants with 'learn by doing' experience through of executing a final interview supported by learning resources, team mentoring and a final evaluation.

 >On one level, documentation is how you capture the definitive, fully detailed record of the interview (the “data”). On another level, it’s how you, as the interviewer, make the 'ah-has' and other important take-aways stick. While doing this, you have to stay engaged with the participant. Beyond that, documentation also bleeds into the sense making and storytelling that follow fieldwork. - [Interviewing Users](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/)

 You've gone through secondary research, planned an interview and tested your emerging skills on willing friends or family. You're finally here - this week you'll conduct your first real interview!

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>What can you tell Mozilla about the Large Screen Experience from the perspective of your interviewee?


#####Activities

* Read Chapter 7 “ Documenting the Interview ".
* Read Chapter 9 “ Making an Impact with your Research ”.
* Do it! Go out and conduct a real-live interview!
* Try to select someone who is not like you (different location, age, background), and thus can provide you with new insights.
Share the results on [Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/your-first-interview/2348)
