### March 9 Community Call(s)

On these calls, we will:
* Brainstorm a light weight community design for launch that feels right for education contributors based on the feedback so far.
* Identify two experiments we can run for outreach, based on a workshop 'Building Bridges to Mozilla'  to bring in opportunity and people.
Launch experiments and community design in the next heartbeat.
