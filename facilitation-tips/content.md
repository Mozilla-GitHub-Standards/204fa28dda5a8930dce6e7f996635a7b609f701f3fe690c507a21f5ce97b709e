### Quick Tips

* Be OK with silence.
* Learn/work alongside participants to generate empathy & trust
* Individual brainstorms before group brainstorms encourage better group discussion
* Find ways to structure activities so ideas from each person are in front of groups, even if people aren't comfortable voicing their ideas.
* Model basic understandings of technical/specialist concepts with hands-on materials or game so people can go to the more difficult parts of workshops with mental models to build from.
* Try to mix up how you 'group' people throughout events.
