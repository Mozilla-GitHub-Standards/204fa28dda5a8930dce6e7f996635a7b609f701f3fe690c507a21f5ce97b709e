A compiled list of facilitation tips, tricks and articles that can help you grow your skills, while improving the outcome of your workshop.

#### Introductions
* **Step Up/Step Down**: Set a tone at the beginning, by encouraging people who usually talk a lot in group settings to 'step back' and do less talking, and those who usually don't speak, to 'step up' and talk a bit more.
* [Event Safety Guidelines](https://github.com/mozilla/participation-org/blob/master/global_events/leadership_summit/code-of-conduct.md): This document, can provide structure for a safe and supportive space.

## General Rules

* Be OK with uncomfortable silence. Give people time to get up the confidence to speak, or answer after a period of thought.
* Learn/work alongside participants to generate empathy & trust.
* You don't have to know everything!  Be open to learning always.
* Encourage diversity of participation and voices.
* Don't be defensive.  If someone doesn't understand your question, or any single point you make - this is an opportunity to improve your workshop.  Ask questions, try new ways of asking your questions.  

## Working with Groups

* Individual brainstorms before group brainstorms encourage better group discussion.
* Find ways to structure activities so ideas from each person are in front of groups, even if people aren't comfortable voicing their ideas.
* Try to mix up how you 'group' people throughout events.
* If someone is talking too much, roams off topic, or a disagreement heats up - try to pull out the main point of the issue, and suggest these are topics that be continued afterwards.


## Technical Workshops
* Model basic understandings of technical/specialist concepts with hands-on materials or game so people can go to the more difficult parts of workshops with mental models to build from.
* It's OK not to know the answer, defer to others if you can, or offer to get back to people if you're unsure.
