#### Description 

Based on Tom Chi's Mozilla Bantina talk: 'Rapid Prototyping', this workshop will take people through a series of 'Mental Debugs' that can help you innovate for better project outcomes in less time.

### Learning Objectives

* The difference between 'guessing' and 'direct experience' in product innovation, and how each impacts progress differently.
* The difference between Adaptability vs. Efficiency in iterating through ideas to find the best ones.

### Audience

## Materials
* Post It notes
* Paper (printer sized)
* Clothes pins
* Elastic bands
* Paper clips
* Paper cups

### Attendee Pre-Work

* None

### Facilitator Pre-Work

* Watch the Air Mozilla talk ['Rapid PrototypingProtyptyping'](https://air.mozilla.org/july-brantina-on-prototyping-with-tom-chi/) by [Tom Chi](http://twitter.com/thegoodtomchi).

### Agenda

1. Introduction
2. Debug 1: Guessing vrs Direct Experience
3. Debug 2: Adaptability vs. Efficiency
4. 

## Introduction

This workshop is based on a talk by Tom Chi.  Tom Chi co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge products including autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons that in the stratosphere provide Internet access.

In groups of 3, your will be engineering the fastest paper airplane. You must use all materials provided to you.

## 1. Guessing vrs Direct Experience

> Key Message:  Guessing without direct experience proves nothing, except perhaps some guesses sound more believable than others.  By creating light-weight experiences to test a hypothesis, we can move more quickly towards our answers and better prototypes. 

### Guessing

Guessing without direct experience provides nothing - except perhaps, some guesses sound more believable.  It might also prove who is better at arguing - and in fact it's usually the better arguer, or higher-ranked person who tends to have the most success in guessing.   

#### Activity

Our goal is to build the fastest paper airplane, but we first need to answer a question: "Should we use cups or paper to build the main frame of our airplane, and why?"

Organize people into groups of 4-5 people, and provide each group with:
* 2 pieces of paper
* 5 elastics
* 5 clothes pins
* 2 per cups

1. Ask groups to share the more popular opinions emerging in their group. Try to draw out whether there were any opinions dismissed early on, and what played a role in forming group opinion. Maybe there was never a consensus, draw this out as well. Key message **proving opinions is  hard and time consuming**. 

### Experience

In contrast, direct experience is about quickly experimenting with those opinions to gather information that tells you what actually works, or doesn't work.

#### Activity

Ask groups to experiment with paper, cups or a mix of both to build a plane structure that they believe will fly furthest, fastest.

Ask the groups to share the experience of building each plane. 
* Did the opinions expressed in the first session evaluate to true?   
* What unexpected things did you learn?  What happen
* What hapened when you learned something (expecting - adjustments, and sometimes big changes.)

**Sharing Tom's story:**  In discussion about Google Glass - discussions were very intense about what text color should be, but that quick experiments quickly proved what the facts were.

## 2. Toolchain Consdierations (Adaptability vs. Efficiency)

Designing for adaptability vrs scalability or efficiency.   

### Scalability & Effeciency

So we have our plane bodies, in rought shape probably, but they're emerging.   And now we need to actually decide now to fly these things.  We have elastic bands, remaining paper cups perhaps - some clothes pins.  With a room of creative people, you'll probably get a lot of different answers as to how you can launch your paper plane for the maximum distance and speed.

### Activity

In groups ask one person to propose their idea, and ask the group to build it in one minute.  (this will not be enough time by a long shot.   

* Ask groups how long they think they need to properly setup for, and test their airplane launch mechanism. Ty to surface people who are worried about time, quality, starting over.  
* **If we invested this much time in every idea, we would be here for quite a long time.**

### Adaptability

Ask groups to revisit the actual problem, and using pen and paper, but to focus on the key problems they were trying to solve for.

If there is an experiment you are going to run more than one time - build a Toolchain for it.
