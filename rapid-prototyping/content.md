<i class="fa fa-pencil fa-3x"></i>  Draft

Based on Tom Chi's Mozilla Bantina talk: 'Rapid Prototyping', this workshop will take people through a series of 'Mental Debugs' that can help you innovate for better project outcomes in less time.

>Rapid prototyping is the process of finding the fastest path to a direct experience of the thing youâ€™re trying to create - Tom Chi

### <i class="fa fa-book"></i> Preparing for this workshop

This workshop has the best results when the right preparation is done in advance.  Everything included in this document is important for the success of the workshop

#### Learning Objectives

* The difference between 'guessing' and 'direct experience' in product innovation, and how each impacts progress differently.
* The difference between Adaptability vs. Efficiency in iterating through ideas to find the best.
* Why 'staying in your medium', when you create and invent

#### Who Can Benefit From This Workshop?

This workshop lends to a diversity of skill-sets, interested in moving towards an innovative goal, more quickly and with greater outcomes.

## Materials & Prep-Work

* Paper in 3 sizes
* Stapler (1 for every 5 people)
* Staples (plenty)
* Tape
* Masking Tape (2 rolls)
* Pencils

#### Outreach & Communication

This workshop can be run alone, or as part of a larger event. No specific pre-event outreach is required.

#### Facilitator Pre-Work

* Watch the Air Mozilla talk ['Rapid PrototypingProtyptyping'](https://air.mozilla.org/july-brantina-on-prototyping-with-tom-chi/) by [Tom Chi](http://twitter.com/thegoodtomchi).

#### Agenda

1. Introduction
2. Debug 1: Guessing vs. Direct Experience
3. Debug 2: Adaptability vs. Efficiency
4. Debug 3: Staying in the Medium
5. Debug 4: Research vs. Development
6. Demos

#### Physical Setup

You will need to build a 'landing strip' area for paper airplane testing

1. The landing strip should allow for maximum flight time of the average airplane without hitting a wall, or other objects like people...
2. Run masking tape along each side of your landing strip, or a [similar formation](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/242842604881657712/) that allows you to track and measure how far our planes will fly.
3. Bonus:  Create one or two 'circles' in the landing strip, for increased difficulty targets.

## Workshop

Start by introducing yourself and your workshop!

> Key Learning:  It's easy to get excited about a design challenge, to immediately dig into complex and advanced solutions - and even to feel confident we're on the right path.

<i class="fa fa-microphone"></i> Speakers Notes

This workshop is based on a talk by Tom Chi.  Tom Chi co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge products including autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons that in the stratosphere provide Internet access.

Before we get started, I'm giving you your first design challenge! Using a pencil and paper, document the steps needed to build the best, fastest most attractive paper plane possible - and describe the technique needed to fly it properly.  

You have only one piece of paper, and it's the one you will be writing your instructions for.  You have 5 minutes to consider your design with these considerations:

1. You will have one piece of paper, a stapler, and tape.
2. Your airplane needs to go the farthest to win.
3. Someone else needs to be able to follow your instructions.

And go!  (time for 5 minutes)

Once everyone has completed their design:

*  Ask who feels they have the solid design?
*  Ask them to hand them to set those aside for now.

## 1. Guessing vrs Direct Experience

> Key Message:  Guessing without direct experience proves nothing, except perhaps that **some guesses** sound more believable than others.  By creating light-weight experiences to test a hypothesis, we can move more quickly towards true knowledge and better prototypes.

### Guessing

<i class="fa fa-microphone"></i> Speakers Notes

When brainstorming solutions it's easy to get stuck in the opinion stage.  The loudest voice in the room, the highest ranked or most persuasive individual will often see their opinions adopted more quickly. Sometimes the more we discuss opinions, the more certain we become.

Options are not proof.

#### Activity

Our goal is to build the fastest paper airplane, but we first need to answer a question - of the three available paper 'shapes'm wgucg is ideal for building paper airplanes?

Form groups of three, to discuss this question for 2 minutes:

"Consider the three choices for paper we have today. Which of these will lend to the best plane results and why?"

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> Ask groups to share the more popular opinions emerging in their group. Try to draw out whether there were any opinions dismissed early on, and what played a role in forming group opinion. Maybe there was never a consensus, draw this out as well. **Proving opinions is  hard and time consuming**.

### Experience

In contrast, direct experience is about quickly experimenting with those opinions to gather information that tells you what actually works, or doesn't work.

#### Activity

Provide each group with one sheet of each sized paper. In each group:

* Ask someone to self-nominate as 'paper plane builder'.
* Ask someone to self-nominate as the 'paper plane tester'.
* Ask someone to self-nominate as the 'success tracker'.

Give each group, 3 minutes to create and test 3 airplanes that test which paper is best. Less direction is better, let the group experiment with however they want to design for each paper-type.

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> State ground rules for orderly testing of planes.

When time is up, ask the following questions:

1. What of the opinions phase was proven?
2. What of the opinions phase was disproven?
3. What did you learn that you couldn't have otherwise without actually trying these tests?
4. To iterate quickly, what steps did you cut out (if any) to build your prototypes faster?


> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> Try to draw out important points that support 'Doesn't Guess Learn' message of Tom's presentation .  If people proved their opinions, that's OK too - the emphasis in on the experience of learning.

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>  Share Tom's Story: In the story of Google Glass - discussions were very intense about what text color should be, opinions were certain red was best, but experimentation proved it was actually the worst color (light blue and yellow were best).  It would have been very hard to argue an opinion that these colors were ideal without actually trying.

## 2. Toolchain Considerations (Adaptability vs. Efficiency)

>Key Learning: Adaptability tested through rapid toolchain testing, is a valuable alternative to engineering for scaling and efficiency.

### Scalability & Efficiency

We spend a lot of time designing for scalability and efficiency - with pure focus on these items.  Rapid prototyping, focuses on designing for adaptability.

<i class="fa fa-microphone"></i> Speakers Notes

We have an emerging sense of how we can use experimentation to quickly determine things that might take a lot longer to understand through even the most educated guess.

Now, what we need to understand is how to optimize for learning that provides us the most information in the shortest period of time.

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>  single-character Tom's Story of designing Google Glass's navigation system.  Developers worked 5 weeks to create the first design, which was apparently terrible.  It would have taken years to complete a six week development process to test each  of 50 navigation ideas.  Instead they created an easy system of testing a variety of different combinations for swiping screens.

### Activity

Design challenge.  How might the addition of staples and/or tape add to the distance a single paper plan can fly?  How can we test this most quickly with the smallest amount of time?   Lets create a toolchain.  A toolchain is a series of actions taken

In new groups of 3:

* Identify the simplest design for a paper plane that can test how tape and staples might improve speed, and accuracy.
* Build as many versions of the paper plane as you have people in your group.
* Have each person experiment with different weighting using staples and/or tape.
* Have each group test their planes, and document the results.

Ask everyone - what they learned.
> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> Try to draw out ideas that explain why reducing time, or removing some parts of the design, allowed them to focus on one specific outcome faster, but more effectively for that outcome.  This is the Rapid, in Rapid Prototyping.

## 3. Staying in the Medium

![painting](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7399/8804107230_00c9686be8.jpg)

> Key Message:  If you are developing software, whether designer, coder or product manager your medium is not pixels, not code, not timelines - its human behavior.

<i class="fa fa-microphone"></i> Speakers Notes

If you think about the way a painter works - they are constantly in their medium.   Imagine though you were an oil painter, but every time you did a brush stroke, you had to write, do a specification, have people accept it, argue with the dev manager, agree to get 20% build, have a QA cycle, and at the end of that we get to do our brush stroke.  And this is how we work all the time.

Not only does this make the 'coming together' of an outcome very small, it makes it harder to get immediate feedback that tells us we're heading in the right direction.  We also segment feedback in phases, which sometimes mean people who were part of initial parts of the process, aren't around in the end to validate

If you work on software, your medium is human behavior in the real world. If you are not looking at the big picture of your work, with human behavior, then that's a huge problem.

Ask your group this question:

"If you were building paper planes for a group of adults who are serious about paper plane races, how would you put yourself in front of them regularly, to get feedback on you're building? "

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> Emphasis the important of putting your product, ideas, and outcome in front of people for regular feedback.  Not as something you do after 10 weeks, but something built into your development workflow.

## 4. Research vrs Development

> Key Message:  Research & Development are very different, and in fact the opposite of each other.

<i class="fa fa-microphone"></i> Speakers Notes  

We often hear the terms Research & Design as separate terms.

Development teaches you, how to go narrow and deep on specific things to focus on reaching specific outcomes.

Research is literally the opposite. Research is the shortest amount of time, where your goal is to hit the widest number of outcomes.

#### TODO Activity (creating 150 planes to see which is best?)

## 5. Improve Your Runtime

> Key Message: Challenge yourself to improve in some small way all you do.

A lot of time we stop improving, because we get stuck on 'good enough'.  The thing about 'good enough' is that we may not be even close to our potential.

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>  Share Tom's Story about learning the cello, or share your own story about goal setting for improvement (whether it's new or inspired).  

#### TODO Activity What can you measure about your work, or processes to challange yourself to improve.

## 5. Wrap-Up

Use wrap-up to ask people how they think they can apply what they've learned to goals they already have for innovating, improving or inventing.
