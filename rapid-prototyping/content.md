#### Description 

Based on Tom Chi's Brantina talk 'Rapid Prototyping', this workshop walks people through a series of 'Mental Debugs' that can help you innovate for better project outcomes in less time.

### Learning Objectives

* The difference between 'guessing' and 'direct experience' in product innovation, and how each impacts progress differently.
* 
 
### Audience


## Materials
* Rectangular, large sized construction paper.
* Marshmellows (small)
* Toothpicks
* Paper Clips

### Attendee Pre-Work

## Introduction

In groups of 3, your will be engineering the best, and fastest paper airplane.

## 1. Guessing vrs Direct Experience

> Key Message:  Guessing without direct experience proves nothing, except perhaps some guesses sound more believable than others.  By creating light-weight experiences to test a hypothesis, we can move more quickly towards our answers and better prototypes. 

### Guessing

Guessing without direct experience provides nothing - except perhaps, some guesses sound more believable.  It might also prove who is better at arguing - and in fact it's usually the better arguer, or higher-ranked person who tends to have the most success in guessing.   

#### Activity

Prior to handing out materials including marshmellows, ask participants to discuss in groups, and to write do their best guesses asnwers to the following questions:

* "How would you build the fastest paper airplane?"  (1 minute)
* "How would you build the fastest airplane, capable of carrying 5 marshmellows (2 minute)

Ask the group if there are any clear opinions emerging for each.  Try to draw out whether there were some weaker opinions that were more quickly dismissed, and what played a role in forming group opinion.  

### Experience

In contrast, direct experience is about quickly experimenting with those opinions to gather information that tells you what actually works, or doesn't work.

#### Activity

Handout materials, giving each team two pieces of paper (one for each plane), a varying amount of marshmellows (some groups get one, others get a few more).  Ask them  to answer these similar questions, this time with materials, and testing the opinions they had in the first round:

* "How would you build the fastest paper airplane?"  (2 minute)
* "How would you build the fastest airplane, capable of carrying your marshmellows (4 minute)

Ask the groups to share the experience of building each plane.  Did the opinions expressed in the first session evaluate to true?   What unexpected things did you learn?

## Staying in the Medium

## Research vrs Development
