#### Description 

Based on Tom Chi's Brannier talk 'Rapid Prototyping', this workshop walks people through a series of 'Mental Debugs' that can help you innovate for better project outcomes in less time.

### Learning Objectives

* The difference between 'guessing' and 'direct experience' in product innovation, and how each impacts progress differently.
* The difference between Adaptability vs. Efficiency in iterating through ideas to find the best ones.

### Audience

## Materials
* Rectangular, large sized construction paper (2 per group)
* Marshmellows (small)
* Toothpicks
* Paper Clips

### Attendee Pre-Work

* None

### Facilitator Pre-Work

* Watch the Air Mozilla talk ['Rapid PrototypingProtyptyping'](https://air.mozilla.org/july-brantina-on-prototyping-with-tom-chi/) by [Tom Chi](http://twitter.com/thegoodtomchi).

### Agenda

1. Introduction
2. Debug 1: Guessing vrs Direct Experience
3. Debug 2: Adaptability vs. Efficiency
4. 

## Introduction

This workshop is based on a talk by Tom Chi.  Tom Chi co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge products including autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons that in the stratosphere provide Internet access.

In groups of 3, your will be engineering the fastest paper airplane. You must use all materials provided to you.

## 1. Guessing vrs Direct Experience

> Key Message:  Guessing without direct experience proves nothing, except perhaps some guesses sound more believable than others.  By creating light-weight experiences to test a hypothesis, we can move more quickly towards our answers and better prototypes. 

### Guessing

Guessing without direct experience provides nothing - except perhaps, some guesses sound more believable.  It might also prove who is better at arguing - and in fact it's usually the better arguer, or higher-ranked person who tends to have the most success in guessing.   

Sharing Tom's story:  In discussion about Google Glass - discussions were very intense about what text color should be. 

#### Activity

Prior to handing out materials including marshmallows, ask participants to discuss in groups, and to write do their best guesses answers to the following questions:

* "How would you build the fastest paper airplane?"  (1 minute)
* "How would you build the fastest airplane, capable of carrying 5 marshmallows (2 minute)

Ask the group if there are any clear opinions emerging for each.  Try to draw out whether there were some weaker opinions that were more quickly dismissed, and what played a role in forming group opinion.  

### Experience

In contrast, direct experience is about quickly experimenting with those opinions to gather information that tells you what actually works, or doesn't work.

#### Activity

Handout materials, giving each team two pieces of paper (one for each plane), a varying amount of marshmallows (some groups get one, others get a few more).  Ask them  to answer these similar questions, this time with materials, and testing the opinions they had in the first round:

* "How would you build the fastest paper airplane?"  (2 minute)
* "How would you build the fastest airplane, capable of carrying your marshmellows (4 minute)

Ask the groups to share the experience of building each plane.  Did the opinions expressed in the first session evaluate to true?   What unexpected things did you learn?

**Sharing Tom's story**:  In the Google Glass example Tom created a prototype that demonstrated text in the colors of the rainbow. Red turned out to be the worst color by far.  The best colors: white, light blue and yellow. Imagine in discussion, how difficult it would have been to champion, and argue for those colors. It wouldn't have happened.

In direct experience you know very quickly.  In opinion, you can end up arguing, and questioning if people understand you... it can take a lot longer.

## 2. Adaptability vs. Efficiency (Scalability)

We tend to spend a lot of time focused on scalability, and efficiency.  Another possible attribute is to design for adaptability.

If there is an experiment you are going to run more than one time - build a Toolchain for it.

### Activity

* Give teams 2 minutes to take the best ideas from their last session to polish their airplane from the last session.
* Propose this nest proble: How can you best protect your marshmellow plane from being damanged on landing.

**Sharing Tom's story**:  Once Google Glass was wearable, the question became how should build the navigation, and as hyou would expect there were many ideas.  And the dev team decided to just build it - and after a few weeks one version of the navigation was built. It was terrible.  But the team had several versions to test and at this rate of testing it would take a very long to time to test one.
