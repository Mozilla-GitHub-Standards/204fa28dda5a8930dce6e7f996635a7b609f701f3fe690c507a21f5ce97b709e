## Overview

This is a foundational session for Personal Leadership in Mozilla.  This engaging workshop will equip participants with the opportunity to deepen self awarenes while exploring how others may learn, adapt, and percieve similar problems and situations differently. These foundational skills are key to building strong effective teams in Mozilla's volunteer communities.

### Learning Objectives

 * Internalize that “leadership is a refactoring job” -- that self-development and learning are keys to effectively mobilizing others and leading teams in Mozilla.
 * Internalize that “Teaming” -- forming and building effective teams -- is crucial for our communities to have impact in this next phase of Mozilla’s mission.
 * Understand own personality type (through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), how this differs from others, and how this related to effective teams.
 
### Audience

* Leaders and emerging leaders at Mozilla, or any FOSS community interested in building strong teams.
* Regional community groups.
* Professional leaders interested in investing volunteer time in Mozilla's community.
* Youth leaders.
* Project teams, that inlude volunteers.

### Attendee Pre-Work

Prior to the event, ask all participants to take the [16 Personalities](http://www.16personalities.com) test, and to bring their results, INCLUDING percentages.

*Note: During this exercise, we will emphasize that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is merely a handy tool to increase self-awareness and the differences in how people might interact in certain situations. It isn’t meant to constrain or classify personalities: In fact it is just the opposite – it is another tool to help understand how one can adapt to different situations and interactions.*

## Workshop

### Slide 0: Agenda and Workshop Goals

Welcome to this session exploring your personal leadership. You are here today, not just as great members of this community, but as people with proven or emerging leadership.  

This workshop is about getting inside your strengths, weaknesses and tendencies as a leader in Mozilla. It’s also about having a common language we can all refer to during this session and beyond. 

And it’s a fun and really interactive session!

Now, we know that the word “Leadership” is problematic in some cultures and communities. It represents power and hierarchy - in some ways the opposite values of Mozilla’s communities. For the purposes of today’s session, let’s park some of these debates about language - if you’re getting caught up on the word, just think of replacing it with **“someone who mobilizes other Mozillians”.**

**Before we get started, you'll need:**

* A pen and paper
* Your MB test results from 16 personalities, including letters (ie: INFJ) and percentages.

Here's our agenda...

## Slide 1: Exploring Leadership

> Key Message: Leadership is an inside job

This is a very rapid quick (5 min) exploration of leadership. It’s just meant to be a thought-starter and entry into the rest of the workshop - **the key is to not get stuck on what is, and is not leadership.**

Think for a moment about the term distributed leadership.

When you think of distributed leadership -- as Mark talked about it this morning in the opening keynote -- think about what resonated positively with you. Take a minute to write down 3 positive qualities of leaders that come to mind when you think about this type of distributed leadership? Maybe you can even think of the positive traits a leader you respect has.

Each person writes 3 qualities of their “example” that makes them effective at mobilizing others. (1 min)
Each person then circles what they think is the “most important” quality (note: you can qualify “most important” as being the quality that stands out right now … no need to get hung up on this step as it’s not an academic exercise)
Open space exercise where people move around the room to form groups of people with similar circled words (3 min)
Facilitator: Stand up on a chair and go around to each group to hear from them on why they think that trait is really important.
Emphasize that there is no one recipe and that no one person can be all of these things, but…
...emphasize self-awareness to understand what traits you bring, and self development (draw this out of the group) as a critical quality to build an individual's unique (and authentic) style. (1 min)
Put this on a flipchart or slide: “Leadership is an inside job”
Debrief what this means to people.
