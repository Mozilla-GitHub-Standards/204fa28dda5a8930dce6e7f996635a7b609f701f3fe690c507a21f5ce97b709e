# Overview

This is a foundational session for Personal Leadership in Mozilla.  This engaging workshop will equip participants with the opportunity to deepen self awarenes while exploring how others may learn, adapt, and percieve similar problems and situations differently. These foundational skills are key to building strong effective teams in Mozilla's volunteer communities.

 * Understand own personality type (through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), how this differs from others, and how this related to effective teams.
 
### Audience

* Leaders and emerging leaders at Mozilla, or any FOSS community interested in building strong teams.
* Regional community groups.
* Professional leaders interested in investing volunteer time in Mozilla's community.
