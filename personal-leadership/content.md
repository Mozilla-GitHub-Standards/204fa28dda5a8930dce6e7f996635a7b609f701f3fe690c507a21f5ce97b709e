This is a foundational session for Personal Leadership in Mozilla.  This engaging workshop will equip participants with the opportunity to deepen self awareness while exploring how others may learn, adapt, and perceive similar problems and situations differently. These foundational skills are key to building strong effective teams in Mozilla's volunteer communities.

### Learning Objectives

 * Internalize that “leadership is a refactoring job” -- that self-development and learning are keys to effectively mobilizing others and leading teams in Mozilla.
 * Internalize that “Teaming” -- forming and building effective teams -- is crucial for our communities to have impact in this next phase of Mozilla’s mission.
 * Understand own personality type (through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), how this differs from others, and how this related to effective teams.
 
### Audience

* Leaders and emerging leaders at Mozilla, or any FOSS community interested in building strong teams.
* Regional community groups.
* Professional leaders interested in investing volunteer time in Mozilla's community.
* Youth leaders.
* Project teams, that include volunteers.

*Note: During this exercise, we will emphasize that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is merely a handy tool to increase self-awareness and the differences in how people might interact in certain situations. It isn’t meant to constrain or classify personalities: In fact it is just the opposite – it is another tool to help understand how one can adapt to different situations and interactions.*

## Workshop

Below are facilitation notes, to lead this workshop from beginning to end, organized by slide .


#### Slide : Personal Leadership

Welcome to this session exploring your personal leadership. You are here today, not just as great members of this community, but as people with proven or emerging leadership.  

This workshop is about getting inside your strengths, weaknesses and tendencies as a leader in Mozilla. It’s also about having a common language we can all refer to during this session and beyond. 

And it’s a fun and really interactive session!

Now, we know that the word “Leadership” is problematic in some cultures and communities. It represents power and hierarchy - in some ways the opposite values of Mozilla’s communities. For the purposes of today’s session, let’s park some of these debates about language - if you’re getting caught up on the word, just think of replacing it with **“someone who mobilizes other Mozillians”.**

**Before we get started, you'll need:**

* A pen and paper
* Your MB test results from 16 personalities, including letters (i.e.: INFJ) and percentages.

#### Slide: Agenda

Here's our agenda...

1. This - Agenda and workshop goals - 5 min  
2. Exploring leadership - 5 min
3. Professional growth - 20 min
4. Myers-Briggs Type Indicators - 25 min
5.  Wrap-up - 10 min

### Exploring Leadership (5 minutes)
#### Slide: ""Leadership is an inside job"

> Key Message: ""Leadership is an inside job""

This is a very rapid quick (5 min) exploration of leadership. It’s just meant to be a thought-starter and entry into the rest of the workshop - **the key is to not get distracted by debate as to what is, and is not leadership.**

Think for a moment about the term distributed leadership. What positively resonates for you about this term, in your personal experiences and optimistic vision for your community?

#####Facilitation Workflow:

Prompt your group with these questions, challenges and direction. Be sure to echo feedback, ideas and inspiration that feel meaningful for the entire group.

**Give each question about 1 minute, the group feedback no more than 3 minutes.**

1. Ask each person to write down 3 positive qualities of the leader that came to mind.
2. Ask each person to then circle the one thing they think is the "most important" quality.  (encourage them to go with their instinct, this is not an academic exercise)
3. Ask people to circulate the room to find people  with similarly circled words to form groups.
4. Ask each group to articulate why their trait is most important.  
	* Facilitation Note: Stand on a chair next to each group, to keep audience attention, and to better echo important statements.
5. Referring to the slide - ask people what "Leadership is an inside job" means to them.
	
### Professional Growth (20 minutes)

This section has a focus on helping people build honesty into their self-assessment.

> Key Message: A key element of leadership is consciously thinking about what you are good at, what you need to work on, and committing to action that helps you grow personally through this awareness.
	
#### Slide: Stages of Growth Model

##### Facilitation Workflow

Articulate to your group this message: "A key element of leadership is consciously thinking about what you are good at, what you need to work on."

Read through the stages of growth from 'Unconsciously Unskilled' to 'Unconsciously Skilled', and give a personal example of how that can be understood.  

Note: If you don't have a personal example you can use one of being 'unintentionally rude in email, recognizing that, working on it, and then proper etiquette in emails being something you stop thinking about, and just do.

1. Handout pieces of paper, and ask people to draw a vertical line down the middle.
2. On the left hand side, write 3 things you are *consciously unskilled* at, with regard to mobilizing/committing and leading others.
	* Ask the group to think about: "What do you have to accomplish next on these?"
	* Ask to think about: "What do you choose to improve?""  Or set goals for committing to action?
3. On the right hand side, please write down 3 things that you are unconsciously unskilled at with respect to mobilizing/leading others.  **Note** *this is a trick - obviously they don't know what they are unconsciously 'not good at' :)  (they should get the trick immediately).*
	* Discussion question: "How should you know what is on the right side of the page?"  *Try to draw out and repeat key things like "feedback from others etc."*
4. Now, on the right hand side, please write down 102 things you can do during this workshop to uncover that unconsciously unskilled space..
5. Finally, flip the page over and write 3 things you 'know you know' about being a leader.  (strengths you have today).
