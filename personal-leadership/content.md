This is a foundational session for Personal Leadership in Mozilla.  This engaging workshop will equip participants with the opportunity to deepen self awarenes while exploring how others may learn, adapt, and percieve similar problems and situations differently. These foundational skills are key to building strong effective teams in Mozilla's volunteer communities.

### Learning Objectives

 * Internalize that “Teaming” -- forming and building effective teams -- is crucial for our communities to have impact in this next phase of Mozilla’s mission.
 * Understand own personality type (through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), how this differs from others, and how this related to effective teams.
 
### Audience

* Leaders and emerging leaders at Mozilla, or any FOSS community interested in building strong teams.
* Regional community groups.
* Professional leaders interested in investing volunteer time in Mozilla's community.

*Note: During this exercise, we will emphasize that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is merely a handy tool to increase self-awareness and the differences in how people might interact in certain situations. It isn’t meant to constrain or classify personalities: In fact it is just the opposite – it is another tool to help understand how one can adapt to different situations and interactions.*

## Workshop

Below are facilitation notes, to lead this workshop from beginning to end, organized by slide number.


#### Slide 0: Agenda and Workshop Goals

Welcome to this session exploring your personal leadership. You are here today, not just as great members of this community, but as people with proven or emerging leadership.  

This workshop is about getting inside your strengths, weaknesses and tendencies as a leader in Mozilla. It’s also about having a common language we can all refer to during this session and beyond. 

And it’s a fun and really interactive session!

Now, we know that the word “Leadership” is problematic in some cultures and communities. It represents power and hierarchy - in some ways the opposite values of Mozilla’s communities. For the purposes of today’s session, let’s park some of these debates about language - if you’re getting caught up on the word, just think of replacing it with **“someone who mobilizes other Mozillians”.**

**Before we get started, you'll need:**

* A pen and paper
* Your MB test results from 16 personalities, including letters (ie: INFJ) and percentages.

Here's our agenda...

1. This - Agenda and workshop goals - 5 min  
2. Exploring leadership - 5 min
3. Professional growth - 20 min
4. Myers-Briggs Type Indicators - 25 min
5.  Wrap-up - 10 min

#### Slide 1: Exploring Leadership

> Key Message: Leadership is an inside job

This is a very rapid quick (5 min) exploration of leadership. It’s just meant to be a thought-starter and entry into the rest of the workshop - **the key is to not get distracted by debate as to what is, and is not leadership.**

Think for a moment about the term distributed leadership. What positively resonates for you about this term, in your personal experiences and optimistic vision for your community?

Facilitation Workflow:

* (1 minute) Ask person to write down 3 positive qualities of leaders that come to mind when they think of distributed leadership - of positive traints a leader they respect has.
* (1 minute) Ask each person to circle what they think is the **most important** quality.  For clarity, this is simply something that stands out right now, as being most important. Encourage people to lead with their instinct.
* (3 minutes) Ask people to move around thhe room to form groups of people with similar circled words.  
	* (Facililtator) Stand up on a chair and go around each group to hear from them on why they think those traits are really important.
		* Try to echo back feedback that feels particularly meaningful to the outcomes of this workshop**
	* Empahsize in wrapping up these 3 minutes, that no one person can be all of these things.
* (3 minutes) Emphasize self-awareness in understnading what traits you bring, and self development as critical quality to build each individual's unqiue and authentic style.
	* On a central Flipcart write:  "Leadership is an inside job".
	* Ask for perspectives on what this means.
