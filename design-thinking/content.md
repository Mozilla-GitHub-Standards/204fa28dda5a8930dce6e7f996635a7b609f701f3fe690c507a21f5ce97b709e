>"At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.” - mozilla.org

This workshop will increase participants awareness of the possible, probable and desirable futures for innovation at Mozilla.  The process will help participants  emerge with an attitude of 'prototyping in all we do', an appreciation of key forces influencing change, and goals for measurement. Human Centered Design will facilitate conversations about innovation at Mozilla in a way that innovates for the success of people on the mission we care so much about.

> "Design thinking" is the practice of solving problems for humans, with other humans. Instead of working with hypothetical arguments or problem sets, learners engage real-world problems and work together on proposed solutions. Education folks might also use the terms authentic assessments or experiential learning to describe these kinds of assignments.
In "Design Challenges" learners select a problem, conduct research with users, prototype a solution, give and receive feedback, and iterate to produce a final project.
IDEO, the innovative design agency, has created a Design Toolkit for Educators which helps teachers co-design solutions with students

We borrow heavily from [d-school's Crash Course in Design Thinking](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/) which is available under Creative Commons ([CC BY-NC 3.0Licence](CC BY-NC 3.0Licence)). Web believe [human centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) will our  encourages better solutions for people, by ensuring empathy at the center of all we do.   

### <i class="fa fa-book"></i> Preparing for this workshop

#### Learning Objectives

* Improved  capacity to imagine, assess and put into practice ideas that push Mozilla’s mission forward through innovation and participation.
* Encourage ideation, rapid prototyping and ‘early sharing’ of ideas across roles, and into volunteer communities for feedback.
* Understand ‘bias towards action’, experimenting, testing and sharing.
Identify possible resources, activities and events in the broader organization where collaboration can be ongoing. (silo busting).
* Identify skills, knowledge and perspectives crucial to achieving the envisioned future.
* Encourage self-reflection and accountability of individual goals for success. “Own what you do”.
* Help participants gain an awareness of possible, probable and desirable outcome for innovation at Mozilla.

#### Who can benefit from this workshops

This workshop can benefit anyone interested in evolving or improving their innovation processes through design thinking.

## Materials & Pre-Work

#### Materials

* [Print Design Thinking Worksheet](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Participant-Worksheet.pdf) . It’s available in a [few languages](https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/31fbd/NonEnglishLanguage_Assets.html).  You may only need the first sheet depending on the [focus you choose](/modules/participation_design_thinking/workshop/).
* Bring colorful markers or crayons so when people engage in solutions they feel they are in a creative environment.
* Bring sticky notes, should you not have access to a large writing space, but usually these are good to have.
* Whiteboard or Flip-Chart to record notes and group observations.

#### Outreach & Communication

There is no pre-work required by participants, but answer is **anyone working on, or near Participation at Mozilla**: volunteers, staff of any confidence level, experience or curiosity.  **The more voices the better, the greater diversity - the better.**

#### Facilitator Pre-Work

* Completed this 90 minute [Design Thinking Crash Course](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/)), or have been a participant in this workshop previously.

#### Agenda

1. Introducing Design Thinking
2. Introductions/Icebreaker
3. Design Thinking

#### Physical Setup

Ideal space allows your group to have 'whole group' and team discussions.   Places chairs in a circle is a great way to get everyone engaged and ready to participate vrs. 'presentation style'.

## Workshop

![workshop](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8282/7711304608_a5396e3a4d.jpg)

If this is your first time running this workshop, or you appreciate a checklist for warming up and preparing your group, here is a suggested introductory workflow:

* Introduce yourself, and feel free to personalize the reasons why you are involved in leading this workshop, or have an interest in innovation at Mozilla at Mozilla.
* Introduce Design Thinking as the methodology we’ll be using to help guide the group’s goals for Participation. If it helps, you can emphasize that human centered design is all about people an alignment with our own mission.
* Share your enthusiasm! Encourage participants to embrace a fun, collaborative and creative experience!
* Introduce and briefly touch on the 5 components of Design Thinking:
  *  **Empathy**: Thinking about and talking to, and listening to people.
  *  **Define** a problem statement.
  *  **Ideate**: Brainstorming lots of ideas to solve that problem.
  *  **Prototype**: Build and make things to test.
  *  **Test**: We won’t actually test, but we will ensure participants leave with goals for testing.
* Be clear that this course will help people define and solve for problems problem in a new and innovative ways, or help ideate on ideas they may already have.
* Provide scope: explain that you'll be woking in partners, what materials and that some portions will be timed.
* Provide comfort: there are no right answers, or perfection required.

## 1. Icebreaker!

Often with introductions, we'll ask people to say "Hi my name is...", and then provide a fun response.  With this icebreaker, the innovation will be in the introduction.

Ask people to introduce themselves, using a unique greeting:

As an example this means, if I say:

"Hi my name is Emma and I am from Sooke."
The next person may not use 'Hi' as their greeting.

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>  Encourage people to use other languages, slang, and local content in their greeting.   Emphasize afterwards, the unique perspective every person can bring to the innovation and design process if they have an attitude of improving on what they already

There is also this [great list](https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/k12/wiki/3091c/Improv_activities_for_Design_Thinking.html) of Design Thinking improv activities.

#### Setting Up The Design Challenge

Introduce Design questions.  Even though this workshop is to support better innovation and ideas at Mozilla, it's often better to teach Design Thinking with an unrelated topic to help participants better grasp and understand the concepts of design thinking.   Having said that, there are some related topics that can still be fun.  Here are some Mozilla-related, and unrelated design questions. Pick one for group.

* The Internet of Things -  Data (Mozilla related)
* My commute to work
* Working Open
* "Me time"
* Bullying in schools

## 2. Empathy

Assign people to groups of two, and ensure each has a copy of dschool's [Design Thinking](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Participant-Worksheet.pdf) worksheet, a pencil, and access to colored markers.

* Ask participants to pair up with someone they know least-well in the room.
* Ask people to consider the design challenge you have chosen (and note that it replaces the 'gift giving experience' indicated on dschool sheet)
* Let participants know that segments of the workshop are timed - and to have fun with that.
* Ask each person to identify as either Partner A, or Partner B on their team.

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>  Emphasis listening, not trying to solve for someone’s problem, but gaining empathy for the story they are telling. Detail empathetic values listed in the diagram below.

![empathy](https://www.oercommons.org/media/cache/02/f4/02f456b8e6f7def645a4cc8fa1da4c8c.jpg)

* Start the Workshop interview of Partner A to Partner B switch, after 2 minutes.

Repeat the exercise moving to Step 2 on the sheet (2 minutes each again) - Digging Deeper.  Encourage people to get to the bottom of some more passionate or sensitive story-telling they’ve heard so far.  

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>  To encourage people to be brave in their questions, encourage them to notice when topics feel challenging, or sensitive - to dig deeper when they hit nerves.

## 3. Define

![notes](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2755/4357529719_5548c4fce6.jpg)

Introduce 'define' mode based on the definition below. (Don't read it word for word, but summarize the highlights for you).

![define](https://www.oercommons.org/media/cache/bc/af/bcaf736efdaae94b7fd993e136de7f92.jpg)

Based on the interview, ask people to step into the next activity, by documenting the 'needs' and 'insights' they've heard from their partner.  (3 minutes)

Next: Based on those needs and insights ask everyone to create a Problem statement for their partnership.  Problem statements should start with “How might we...”.

An example might be "How might we improve the experience and duration of our daily commute by leaving at a different time?"

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>  Watch-out: It’s easy to get problem statements that are either too general or just statements of fact. A great problem statement can really unlock creativity.

## 4. Ideate

Summarize the key points of the ideate mode. (don't read word for word)

![](https://www.oercommons.org/media/cache/5c/f5/5cf52dac46219a39dbc88989c50a2779.jpg)

Ask people to sketch at least 5 radical ways to meet their user's needs in Step 5 of the dschool worksheet.  Encourage people to draw their solution vrs getting caught up in words, and details.  If they absolutely must use words, ask them to keep it brief.  (4 minutes)

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> Encourage creativity, using markers, crayons and other materials that make people feel like they're having fun.
> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i>  It’s easy to get problem statements that are either too general or just statements of fact. A great problem statement can really unlock creativity.

When time is up, ask each person to share their solutions with their partner (user), and to capture feedback in box 6. (8 minutes)

#### 5. Reflect

Based on the feedback sketch your emerging big idea, or solution to your user's problem.  (3 minutes).  

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> 3 minutes is obviously not enough time to create beautiful - encourage people not to get hung up on details, but to sketch as detailed a picture as possible of the big picture.

## 6. Prototype

Summarize prototype mode for participants. Emphasis on *getting ideas and explorations out into the physical world*. That prototype should match your learning so far - and can be made of anything.

![prototype](https://www.oercommons.org/media/cache/b8/4c/b84cc336854b27b1441941d39b7da9ec.jpg)

Ask people to try building their solution using physical things.  Minimally it's use of markers and paper, but providing things like pipe cleaners, foam stickers and tape can help people really find their creative space.  (10 minutes)

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> Some people will push back, usually because they are not self-identified as being good at craft/art .  Remind them often, it's not about quality of the prototype, but that we create something our user can physically interact with and understand to test our hypothesis.

## 7. Test

Share a summary of the test mode.  Emphasis that testing is about placing your hypothesis in the human experience.

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> Key Message: Prototype as if you're right, but test as if you know you're wrong.

![test](https://www.oercommons.org/media/cache/68/5f/685fdd1d05fedf36d952e716e4d23c37.jpg)

You have two options for testing (depending on time).  The first is to ask partners to share their solutions with each other, and then come back into a main circle to do some group-sharing.  The other is to move right to group sharing for the purpose of time.   

Ask for volunteers to share their prototype, and the process of learning and iterating that brought them to it. (and then ask their partner for feedback)

> <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> If you've seen a particularly inspiring process that hits our learning outcomes well - invite them to share first.

## Wrap-Up

Wrap-Up should be brief, and emphasis the value in design thinking  - that having an attitude of prototyping in all we do, and interacting with our users regularly, allows us to move towards better solutions for the human experience, faster and with better results.

1) How did it feel develop hypothesis and prototypes in rapid fashion?
2) What did you learn?
3) How might this change how you interact with problems in your work, or day to day life?
